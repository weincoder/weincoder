# Weincoder 🚀

Hello everyone, I hope you are very well. My name is Daniel Herrera Sánchez
I am a human being who is very passionate about learning from everything and everyone. At the age of 17, it was my first encounter with programming. From then on, I was very passionate about seeing how the world of ideas turned into a reality in a software solution without the need for very high investment. Much of what he learned is thanks to the beautiful tech community, which has made me eager to share this knowledge with others. I currently lead a Flutter community in my city, I have a YouTube channel called weincode, and I work as a Senior Front-End at Bancolombia.
